def prim(weights, source=0):
    """
    Prim's Algorithm: Find the minimal cost of every node connected node.
    Produces the minimal spanning tree.

    Time complexity: O(n^2)
    Complexity breakdown:
        for loop outer 1: n
        for loop outer 2: n - 1
        for loop inner 1: n
        for loop inner 2: n
        total: n + (n-1)*2n = O(n^2)

    Parameters
    ----------
    weights (2D array): Adjacency matrix. Connected, weighted, and undirected
        graph of n >= 2.
    source (int): Starting index. No effect on MST total cost but the
        MST tree might be differennt for edges with same weight.

    Return
    ------
    {edges: array of edges (tuple), cost: float}

    NOTES
    -----
    - vnear: Node with min distance at each iteration.
        Node is also index at distance[i] to nearest[vnear].
        Tells us the previous node with min distance at distance[i].
    - distance[]: List of min distances at each iteration.
    - nearest[]: List of vnear nodes for distance in distance[i]
        nearest[vnear] to get node corresponding to distance[i].
    - final_edges[]: Resultant array of edges that produces the minimal
                     spanning tree (MST).

    Algorithm finishes when distance[] is populated with all -1
