def dijkstra(weights, start_vertex):
    """
    Dijkstra's Algorithm: Find the shortest path from one starting vertex to
    every other vertices. Produces the shortest path spanning tree.

    Parameters
    ----------
    weights (array): 2D array of weights between edges
    start_vertex (int): Starting index

    Return
    ------
    {edges: array of tuple, touch: array of tuple}

    NOTES
    -----
    - vnear: the nearest vertex from index at length[i] to touch[vnear].
           Tells us which previous vertex has the smallest length at length[i].
    - length[]: Has the total legnth of the current iteration
    - touch[]: Has the previous node at corresponding to the total length in
             length[i]. Use touch[vnear] to get previous node.
    - final_edges[]: the resultant array of edges that produces the shortest
                     path tree.

    Algorithm finishes when length[] is populated with all -1

    DIFFERENCE FROM PRIM
    --------------------
    Consider 3 nodes: X, Y, Z.
    Total cost is 4 to connect all nodes together. Cost 2 from X -> Z.
