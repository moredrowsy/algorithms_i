Dijkstra's Algorithm: Find shortest path tree from single source
"""


def dijkstra(weights, source):
    """
    Dijkstra's Algorithm: Find the shortest path from one source node to
    every other nodes. Produces the shortest path spanning tree.

    Time complexity: O(n^2)
    Complexity breakdown:
        fro loop outer 1: n
        for loop outer 2: n - 1
        for loop inner 1: n
        for loop inner 2: n
        total: n + (n-1)*2n = O(n^2)

    Parameters
    ----------
    weights (2D array): Adjacency matrix. Connected, weighted, and directed
        graph of n >= 2.
    source (int): Starting index

    Return
    ------
    {edges: array of tuple, predecessor: array of parent nodes}

    NOTES
    -----
    - vnear: Node with min distance at each iteration.
        Node is also index at length[i] to touch[vnear].
        Tells us the previous node min total length at length[i].
    - length[]: List of min total length at each node.
    - touch[]: List of vnear nodes for total length in length[i]
        touch[vnear] to get node corresponding to length[i]
    - final_edges[]: Resultant array of edges that produces the shortest
        path tree.

    Algorithm finishes when length[] is populated with all -1

    DIFFERENCE FROM PRIM
    --------------------
    Consider 3 nodes: X, Y, Z.
    Total cost is 4 to connect all nodes together. Cost 2 from X -> Z.
        2
